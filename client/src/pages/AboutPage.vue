      <p>
        Firstly, I'd like to express my gratitude for your interest in Delicious
        Magic. As this is my exam project, I imagine you might be a fellow
        student or one of our examiners/teachers. In either case, a warm welcome
        to you and I hope your experience has been (or will be) positive!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're an enthusiastic explorer who has stumbled upon Delicious
        Magic, I'm happy it has piqued your curiosity! This App is purely
        academic and not intended for commercial use. It serves as a testament
        to my learning journey in VueJS. While it's at a beginner level, I
        acknowledge there's room for growth. But with time, I hope to make it
        better (as they say, Rome was not built in a day, nor in a week I would
        add).
      </p>
